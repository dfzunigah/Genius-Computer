# Genius-Computer
Simple logic Java game

# Synopsis

The "game" original idea was taken from a MOOC from the University of Helsinki. I took the idea and developed it further adding new features and stuff. It's a simple program but it involves almost everything of Java basics. It also set the opportunity to learn how GitHub works and learn more about how to develop projects and software. I'd appreciate any improvement you can tell me or what I can do better. I'm starting to code so not that into big deals but I learn fast :)

# Motivation

This is a simple "game", I started developing it in a way I could also try and test GitHub. The concept behind the game is quite simple: You provide a range and then you think of a number on that range, the computer tries to guess the number you thought.

# Installation

Releases include the source code of the project and an aditional .JAR file, so no installation required, just open the .JAR file (by doing double click on it) or compile the source code (For example on NetBeans or Eclipse). 

# API Reference

Documentation of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/dfzunigah/Genius-Computer/blob/master/Documentation.pdf)

If you'd like to contribute to the project give me a shoutout at Twitter or here's a [link](https://github.com/dfzunigah/Genius-Computer) to the GitHub project. All ideas are welcomed :)

# Tests

The program has been tested and all visible bugs have been removed, anyways if you realize there's something wrong, give me a shotout. This is a very basic program so there's no test battery.
